                        <p>&bull; Direct or indirect, material or consequential, foreseeable or unforeseeable damage to
                            the USER arising from the use or difficulty to use the WEBSITE or its SERVICES.</p>

                        <p>&bull; Illegal use of the WEBSITE, without MIRACLE having been duly aware, within the meaning
                            of the French law No. 2004-575 of 21 June 2004 on Confidence in the Digital Economy and the

                            processing of personal data.</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE does not guarantee the effectiveness, completeness, accuracy, result and/or
                            effectiveness of the documents that the USER may create on the website.</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE shall not be held liable for any error, omission or inaccuracy of the proposed
                            templates and any damage suffered by the USER who has created a document on the website.</p>
                        <p>The USER is responsible for:</p>
                        <p>&bull; Protecting its equipment and data;</p>
                        <p>&bull; The use made of the WEBSITE or SERVICES;</p>

                        </p>
                        <h3>ARTICLE 3 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
                        <p>All of the WEBSITE's elements (including ergonomics, texts, graphs, images, sounds, videos,
                            programming elements, database - this list shall not be considered exhaustive), together or
                            separately, are the exclusive property of MIRACLE, protected pursuant to the moral and
                            patrimonial rights belonging to their author(s) under the provisions of Articles L. 111-1
                            and following of the Code of Intellectual Property.</p>
                        <p>Access to the WEBSITE does not represent the recognition of a right, and does not confer any
                            rights, including any intellectual property rights relating to any of the elements of the
                            WEBSITE, which remain MIRACLE's exclusive property.</p>
                        <p>Any representation, reproduction, adaptation or partial or total exploitation of the
                            contents, trademarks, and services provided by the WEBSITE by any means whatsoever without
                            the prior express and written consent of MIRACLE is strictly prohibited and may constitute a
                            counterfeiting infringement under the Articles L.335-2 and following of the Code of
                            Intellectual Property.</p>
                        <p>The USER is forbidden to enter data on the WEBSITE that would likely alter its content or
                            appearance.</p>
                        <h3>ARTICLE 4 - SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p>USERS in certain countries may have the option to access the SERVICES by using a subscription
                            in order to benefit from unlimited access to the catalog of templates and to create
                            documents for the duration of the subscription. USERS in France may also utilize the
                            subscription service to benefit from a preferential rate when contacting a lawyer.</p>
                        <p>If subscription service is not provided in the country for which you are requesting
                            documents, the terms in this provision are not relevant.</p>
                        <p>This subscription is completed by creating an account and filling out a subscription form, in
                            which the USER must choose a valid method of payment.</p>
                        <p>The frequency of the subscription is selected by the USER according to the options offered by
                            the WEBSITE.</p>
                        <p>The subscription to the WEBSITE is automatically renewed before the end of each subscription
                            period until termination. The USER may receive a free trial period if the WEBSITE offers
                            one. After this trial period, the USER is automatically debited the amount specified on the
                            WEBSITE. This amount may vary.</p>
                        <p>The USER also has the option to terminate the subscription at any time. In case of
                            termination during the trial period, if one is offered by the WEBSITE, no direct debit shall
                            be made. However, any termination during the trial period prevents the USER from being
                            entitled to benefit from one again. Thus, if the USER wishes to benefit again from the
                            SERVICES, no new trial period will be granted.</p>
                        <p>If the USER wishes to terminate the subscription before the renewal date, the USER will
                            continue to access the SERVICES offered by the WEBSITE until the end of the current billing
                            period. There will be no refund granted for periods of partial use of the SERVICES. The USER
                            may choose to reactivate their account after termination if desired.</p>
                        <h2 class="w-100">ARTICLE 5 - PRICE</h2>
                        <p>5.1 Purchase of individual documents</p>
                        <p>The WEBSITE provides USERS with a catalog of templates to fill out to create documents.</p>
                        <p>Prices and taxes to buy the templates are indicated in the catalog.</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE reserves the right to change its prices at any time by posting them online.</p>
                        <p>The only prices applicable to USER transactions are the ones in effect at the time the
                            purchase is made.</p>
                        <p>The prices are quoted in the official currency of the country where the SERVICES are made
                            available. In the United States of America (hereinafter "U.S."), the prices are quoted in
                            U.S. dollars, all taxes included.</p>
                        <p>The prices include the taxes applicable on the date of the purchase and any change in the
                            rate of these taxes will be reflected in the price of the templates in the catalog.</p>
                        <p>The total amount of the purchase, including all taxes, is indicated before the final
                            confirmation of the purchase order.</p>
                        <p>The payment of the full price must be made when the purchase is made.</p>
                        <p>5.2 Subscription</p>
                        <p>The WEBSITE may provide subscription services to USERS in certain nations. If subscription
                            services are provided, the terms outlined in this subsection will apply to govern the
                            subscription services. If subscription services are not provided to USERS in your nation,
                            the terms in this provision will not be relevant. The WEBSITE may provide USERS with the
                            ability to subscribe in order to benefit from the proposed SERVICES and therefore have
                            unlimited access to the WEBSITE catalog.</p>
                        <p>The subscription enables the USER to allow MIRACLE to periodically debit a financial account
                            that the USER has provided, depending on the subscription the USER has chosen. USERS in
                            France may also utilize the subscription service to benefit from a preferential rate when
                            contacting a lawyer.</p>
                        <p>The price of the subscription is indicated in the official currency of the country where the
                            subscription services are made available, all taxes included.</p>
                        <p>The price of the subscription will be the one in effect at the time of the USER's initial
                            subscription. The WEBSITE reserves the right to change the offer and the price of the
                            subscription, after notifying the USER.</p>
                        <p>When the USER chooses to subscribe, a free trial period may be available, if the WEBSITE
                            chooses to offer one. After this trial period, the USER will be charged with the amount
                            corresponding to the cost of the subscription, unless the USER decides to terminate its
                            subscription before the end of the free trial period.</p>
                        <p>5.3 VAT collection in France and within the European Union</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE collects VAT for any USER from a member state in the European Union. This is done to
                            ensure compliance with all applicable collection rules as well as to assist in the
                            maintenance of appropriate tax responsibilities for all parties.</p>
                        <p>For products sold in the European Union, the WEBSITE lists prices inclusive of VAT.</p>
                        <p>The VAT rate applied by MIRACLE is that of the purchaser&rsquo;s country on the date the
                            purchase is made. MIRACLE forwards the collected VAT payment to the tax authorities in the
                            country of purchase.</p>
                        <p>USERS that are professionals liable for payment of VAT in the European Union may ask MIRACLE
                            for an invoice exclusive of VAT,&nbsp; so that the Reverse Charge mechanism may be applied.

                        <p>When the USER chooses to buy an individual document, the USER makes the payment at the time
                            of the final confirmation of the purchase.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of confirmation of the purchase and payment by the USER, the latter will receive
                            an electronic invoice to the email address personally specified.</p>
                        <p>6.2 Subscription</p>
                        <p>The terms in this subpart only apply if subscription services are available in the country

                        <p>At the time of the USER's initial choice to subscribe, the USER gives his banking information
                            for the direct debit which is conducted at each subscription period. The subscription fee to
                            the SERVICES will be charged periodically according the starting date of the first
                            subscription period. The billing schedule may nevertheless be subject to changes.</p>
                        <p>The USER may choose to change the payment method by accessing the USER's specific account on
                            the WEBSITE.</p>
                        <p>If a payment fails because of the expiration of the USER's card, insufficient funds or for
                            any other reason, the WEBSITE reserves the right to suspend the USER's access to the
                            proposed SERVICES, until obtaining a valid payment method.</p>
                        <p>6.3 Financial permissions</p>
                        <p>The USER guarantees to MIRACLE that the USER has the necessary permissions to use the payment
                            method chosen and recognizes that the transmission to MIRACLE of the USER's banking
                            information is evidence of its ability and consent to the sale, and to the payment due
                            pursuant to the purchase.</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE does not save the details of the USER's credit cards, but the proof of the
                            transaction is archived.</p>
                        <p>Should the accredited bodies refuse to authorize the payment by credit card or in case of
                            non-payment, MIRACLE reserves the right to suspend or cancel the purchase and its delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p>MIRACLE also reserves the right to refuse a purchase made by a USER who has not fully paid
                            its purchase or has not fully paid a previous purchase or with whom a dispute is unsettled.
                        </p>
                        <p>MIRACLE is not liable for payment problems related to the operation of the SERVICES. The USER
                            acknowledges sole responsibility for any problems related to the payment method chosen to
                            access the SERVICES.</p>
                        <h3>ARTICLE 7 &ndash; LEGAL ADVICE</h3>
                        <p>This provision shall only be applicable to USERS in France. The specific service of
                            communicating with a lawyer is not available in any other nation.</p>
                        <p>The WEBSITE may offer the USER the possibility of speaking with a lawyer. The WEBSITE only
                            connects the USER with the lawyer, but in no case does it advise the USER in any way
                            whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Under these Terms And Conditions, this service of connecting with a lawyer enables the USER
                            to get the advice of a lawyer for a period of 30 (thirty) minutes. This service is optional,
                            and must be deliberately chosen by the USER if the USER wishes to benefit from it.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the allotted 30 (thirty) minutes, the USER may choose to continue to benefit from the
                            advice of the lawyer without going through the service offered by the WEBSITE, but instead
                            directly through the lawyer.</p>
                        <p>The USER acknowledges that any personal information given by the USER to the lawyer is
                            willingly provided, and the WEBSITE is not liable or responsible for such information
                            disclosure.</p>
                        <p>The WEBSITE does not guarantee the validity and accuracy of the information submitted by the
                            lawyers, nor their work. The WEBSITE shall not be held liable for any legal advice or
                            information provided by the lawyer.</p>
                        <p>The USER and lawyers guarantee to protect and indemnify the WEBSITE and MIRACLE against all
                            claims, demands, losses, actions, suits, judgments, costs, expenses, and damages of any
                            nature whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from the USER's utilization of the WEBSITE
                            SERVICES which allow the USER to contact a lawyer.</p>
                        <h3>ARTICLE 8 - RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</h3>
                        <p>Pursuant to the provisions of Article L.221-28,13&deg; of the French Consumer Code, the USER
                            may not assert a right of withdrawal once the document has been made available to the USER.
                        </p>

                        <p>A USER wishing to register on the WEBSITE must choose a password which is strictly
                            confidential and personal. It is up to the latter to keep it absolutely secret.</p>
                        <p>The USER may close its account automatically by sending a message to the following address:

                        <p>The&nbsp; Data Controller is responsible for any and all decision-making regarding the
                            collection of personal data, such as the means and purposes of processing, as well as the
                            storage and protection of the personal data.</p>
                        <p>10.5 Duties of the&nbsp; Data Controller</p>
                        <p>The&nbsp; Data Controller is committed to the protection and security of all USERS&rsquo;
                            personal data. This includes overseeing all personal data and ensuring that it is never
                            shared with third parties without a USER&rsquo;s valid, freely given, unambiguous consent.
                            The&nbsp; Data Controller&rsquo;s responsibilities also include ensuring that all
                            USERS&rsquo; personal data is used explicitly as described in this policy.</p>
                        <p>The Data Controller is also the party responsible for ensuring that personal USER data is
                            properly adjusted or deleted when a USER requests, unless doing so would lead to a
                            disproportionately large cost or effort.</p>
                        <p>If the integrity, confidentiality or security of personal USER data are compromised, the Data
                            Controller will be the party responsible for informing all USERS.</p>
                        <p>10.6 USER&rsquo;s rights in relation to personal data collected</p>

                            rights:&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&bull; The right to obtain, access, and/or rectify personal data collected by MIRACLE;</p>
                        <p>&bull; The right to erasure of personal data collected by MIRACLE;</p>

                        <p>If there are questions about a USER&rsquo;s rights, that USER may contact the Data Controller
                            using the email address utilized for the purchase of a document or subscription. The&nbsp;
                            Data Controller will respond to the USER in a reasonable time frame, but in no event later
                            than 30 days.</p>
                        <p>The USER may also bring complaints regarding the processing of personal data to a court of
                            competent jurisdiction or the relevant data protection authority. This includes if a USER
                            believes any rights have been infringed.</p>
                        <p>10.7 Conditions applicable to children&rsquo;s consent for the collection of personal data

                            MIRACLE may also create checks to ensure that if a USER is under the relevant age of
                            consent, that proper consent of a parent or legal representative has been obtained.</p>
                        <p>10.8 Cookies</p>
                        <p>MIRACLE may use cookies. A cookie is a small file stored on the USER&rsquo;s computer by

                            shall remain in full and force and effect.</p>

                            MIRACLE's rights.</p>
                        <h3>ARTICLE 13 - AMENDMENT TO THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITION OF USE AND SALE</h3>
